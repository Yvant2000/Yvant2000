Wow hey, welcome on my GitHub page ! 😳 \
I'm programming a lot for fun (yeah, I know, I'm probably messed up), and you can find here some of my projects !



I love **Python**, 🐍\
I kinda enjoy **C**, 😎\
I hate **C++** from the bottom of my heart, and he hates me too, so it's like my Kismesis I would say, 🤮\
Also, **C#** is cool because of **Unity**, 🎮\
And of course, I support **Rust** supremacy 🦀 !
